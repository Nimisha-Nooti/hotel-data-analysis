Analyzing the Hotel booking data.

Due to strong growth of hospitality industry and hotel sector specifically in recent years there is an increased need from management and industry professionals in order to understand how guest select hotels to stay in and what are decision making factors that prevail. Furthermore, goal of this project is to analyse in depth and compare data that is discussing selection process of hotel booking as well as what decision making process guest follow.This is contributed to the fact that most of previous studies focused on choice attributes rather than decision-making process itself.

what we are doing in this kernel is something like:

Basic cleaning : seperating the required data from the data set to use it for analysing.
Understanding the factors effecting the booking : Factors like seasons, festivals and holidays effect the data.
Univariable study : We'll just focus on the dependent variable and try to know a little bit more about it.
Test assumptions : We'll check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques.

There are 119390 rows and  32 columns in the given data set. From the variables we will evaluate the dependency of hotel booking as follows:

  Hotel wise analysis,
  Booking cancellation analysis,
  Bookings based on Meals, Countries, Room Type.,
  Distribution channel wise analysis,
  Lead time analysis,
  Revenue analysis,
  Bookings over time analysis.
